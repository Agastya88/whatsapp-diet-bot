# ðŸ“± WhatsApp Diet Coach

A conversational AI nutrition coach for Indian users â€” powered by Twilio, OpenAI, and Firebase.

This bot lives on WhatsApp and allows users to log food, track weight, get personalized meal plans, and learn about nutrition using natural language.

## Features

- **Natural Language Interactions:**  
  Leverages OpenAI's language models to interpret user messages and provide personalized nutritional advice via a conversational interface.

- **Meal & Weight Logging:**  
  Users can log meals and weight entries. The bot estimates nutritional information (calories, macros) for meals and asks for confirmation before saving the data.

- **Personalized Feedback:**  
  Aggregates user chat history, meal logs, and weight logs to generate actionable, personalized feedback and suggestions aimed at improving nutrition and tracking progress.

- **Multi-Intent Handling:**  
  Supports multiple intents including logging meals, logging weight, retrieving nutritional information, and providing goal-oriented guidance.

- **Scalable & Cloud-Based:**  
  Integrates Firebase for data storage, Twilio for messaging, and Render for hostingâ€”ensuring that the backend scales as the user base grows.

## Architecture Overview

- **Messaging Interface (Twilio):**  
  Handles incoming user messages (via SMS/WhatsApp) and routes them to the backend.

- **Node.js Backend:**  
  Processes webhook requests using a centralized message handler that:
  - Logs user messages and maintains conversational context.
  - Determines the userâ€™s intent using an intent detection service powered by OpenAI.
  - Interacts with Firebase for data storage of user logs and chat history.

- **Firebase Firestore:**  
  Serves as the database for storing user profiles, meal logs, weight logs, and chat history.

- **OpenAI API:**  
  Provides advanced natural language processing:
  - Determines user intent.
  - Generates meal estimations and nutritional information.
  - Creates personalized, constructive feedback based on aggregated user data.

- **Hosting Platform (Render):**  
  Hosts the Node.js backend and scales with the application's needs, ensuring high availability and performance.
